# Andrea Beltrán's Home page

Hello, I'm Andrea Beltrán and this is the webpage I developed for the Web Development class. In this page I talk a little bit about myself, what I do and why.

# Objectives and technologies
My main purpose with this project was to learn the basic techniques of html, css and vanilla javascript. I also used and learned about Bootstrap 4, which I used in the main organization of the website.

# How to run
The page can be viewed and read from any browser, although the use of Mozilla firefox is recommended. You can also run on a server using http-server. Finally, eslint was used for this project
