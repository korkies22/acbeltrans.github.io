          Urban dance
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify p-text">
          Of the things I love most in the world is dancing. From the moment I learned about the existence of urban dance, <b>I knew that was what I wanted to learn.</b> The first class was an unforgettable experience since I was very shy and had never moved my body in a position other than the conventional ones. Over time I began to discover what my favorite styles are: <b>House, Locking, Waacking and Hip Hop.</b> Each of them produces different sensations in me: fun, happiness or serenity. Today I can easily say that this journey has changed my life. Dancing for me means <b>freedom, passion, happiness and expression.</b> There are times when I can manifest things with my dance that would be very complicated to do with my words.

          Swimming

        <p class="text-justify p-text">
          I started swimming since I was a baby. Once I entered school, my parents always took me in the afternoon to train. <b>Swimming has taught me the essence of competing.</b> In this sport you have two rivals: The clock and all those swimmers who are doing the same test. <b>The tests that I have always liked have been those that cover many meters.</b> My favorite is 1500m in freestyle followed by 800m and 400m (also in freestyle). I also like to compete in backstroke and if there was a longer test than the 200m one, I would surely do it. The best part is when one has already been swimming in full competition for approximately 18 minutes and no longer feels the legs. <b>It is at that moment where you know that you must give your best and overcome fatigue to win.</b>
